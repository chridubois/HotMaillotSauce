## Features :
- Seed file built with Web scraping of more than 2000 jerseys to populate the database
- Sign In / Log in with Devise
- Search with pgSearch (I've tried Elastic Search but it was too heavy for heroku ^^)
- Geocoding to find a jersey on a map
- DatePicker implemented by myself with CSS and JS Stimulus
- Price Refresher according to selected dates with JS Stimulus
